# Settings for the service-wide ``/api-docs`` schema, served by drf-spectacular.

# These are passed as ``custom_settings`` to SpectacularAPIView rather than
# living in ``SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS``, because that global is already claimed by
# a deliberately narrow schema in each service -- the Authoring API
# (``/authoring-api/``) in CMS and the Enrollment API (``/lms-api/``) in LMS.
# Both filter the surface down via ``PREPROCESSING_HOOKS`` and trim a path
# prefix, so ``/api-docs`` must switch that filtering off explicitly to cover
# the whole service.
#
# Note this is wider than what edx-api-doc-tools produced: its
# ``ApiSchemaGenerator`` kept only paths under ``/api/`` and pinned the path
# prefix there, so ``/api-docs`` now documents every DRF endpoint in the
# service rather than just the versioned ``/api/*`` surface.
# Note: ``SERVE_*`` settings cannot be overridden through ``custom_settings``
# (drf-spectacular raises AttributeError); SpectacularAPIView takes dedicated
# constructor arguments for those instead.

def cached_schema_view():
    """
    Build the ``/api-docs`` schema view, caching the rendered document compressed.

    ``cache_page`` stores the pickled ``Response``, which for this schema is over
    memcached's default 1MB item limit. ``CACHES['default']`` sets
    ``ignore_exc: True``, so that oversized ``set`` fails silently and Django
    deletes the key -- the endpoint would look cached while regenerating the
    whole schema on every request. Storing the zlib-compressed body instead
    brings it to roughly a tenth of the limit.

    The key covers the URLconf, the path, the negotiated representation and the
    active language. The URLconf because the LMS and the CMS serve this view at
    the same path and share one cache by default, so without it whichever
    service generated first would serve its document at the other's URL. The
    language because drf-spectacular renders the document under whatever
    language is active, and ``LocaleMiddleware`` sets that from the request's
    cookie or ``Accept-Language`` before this runs. Nothing else in it varies by
    requester -- ``SERVE_PUBLIC`` defaults to ``True``, ``SERVE_*`` cannot be set
    through ``custom_settings``, and ``API_DOCS_SETTINGS`` sets ``'SERVERS': []``
    so no ``servers`` block is emitted.

    Only GET and HEAD are cached, as ``cache_page`` did: DRF answers OPTIONS on
    this view with a 200 metadata document, which would otherwise be stored and
    served to the next GET.

    ``drf_spectacular.views`` is imported inside the function rather than at
    module scope: this module is imported from the settings, and importing DRF
    views that early freezes ``api_settings`` before ``DEFAULT_SCHEMA_CLASS`` is
    set, which makes schema generation fail with ``Incompatible AutoSchema used
    on View``.
