# .. toggle_description: Serves the legacy Django CCX Coach dashboard instead of the CCX Coach
#   experience in the Instructor Dashboard MFE. By default the MFE is used: the CCX Coach course tab
#   links to it and the legacy dashboard view redirects there. Enable this flag for a course to opt
#   that course back out to the legacy dashboard. Mirrors the equivalent
#   `instructor.legacy_instructor_dashboard` flag. Note that a waffle flag cannot default to on, so
#   an opt-out is expressed by making the enabled state mean "use legacy". Regardless of this flag,
#   the legacy dashboard is still served when CCX_COACH_MICROFRONTEND_URL is not configured, so the
#   MFE is never linked to at an unusable URL.

# .. toggle_target_removal_date: 2027-04-01
# .. toggle_warning: Requires CCX_COACH_MICROFRONTEND_URL to be set for the MFE to be reachable.
#   That setting defaults to None, so when it is unset the legacy dashboard is served regardless of
#   this flag.
